# Website-Hypothesis-Testing

This Jupyter Notebook is designed to perform hypothesis testing on a dataset containing user interaction metrics. The primary objective is to analyze and compare different themes (e.g., light theme vs. dark theme) to determine if there are statistically significant differences in various metrics.

## Contents

- **Introduction**: Brief overview of the purpose and objectives.
- **Data Import and Description**: Loading the dataset and performing initial data exploration.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducting t-tests to compare means between groups.
- **Results Interpretation**: Analyzing the results of the hypothesis tests.
- **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and potential implications.

## How to Use

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
    Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas scipy
    ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
    Open the notebook `hypothesis_testing.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and run the cells sequentially. This will:
    - Load the dataset.
    - Perform data description and visualization.
    - Conduct hypothesis tests.
    - Provide interpretations of the results.

3. **Interpret the Results**:
    Each section of the notebook includes comments and explanations to help you understand the steps and the outputs. The results from the hypothesis tests will help you determine if there are significant differences between the groups being compared.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Libraries: pandas, scipy

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Theme**: The theme used (e.g., Light Theme, Dark Theme)
- **Click Through Rate**: The rate at which users click on links
- **Conversion Rate**: The rate at which users complete a desired action
- **Bounce Rate**: The rate at which users leave the site after viewing only one page
- **Scroll Depth**: The depth to which users scroll down a page
- **Age**: The age of the user
- **Location**: The geographical location of the user
- **Session Duration**: The duration of the user's session
- **Purchases**: Whether the user made a purchase
- **Added to Cart**: Whether the user added items to the cart

## Hypothesis Testing

The notebook performs t-tests to compare means between different themes. The tests are used to determine if there are statistically significant differences in metrics such as click-through rate, conversion rate, and bounce rate between the light theme and dark theme.

## Conclusion

The notebook concludes with a summary of the findings from the hypothesis tests and provides insights into the potential implications of these findings for website design and user experience.
